Problem 1:

This problem was recently asked by Google.
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Problem 2:

This problem was asked by Uber.
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Problem 4:

This problem was asked by Stripe.
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

Problem 5:

This problem was asked by Jane Street.
cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

Given this implementation of cons:
```python
def cons(a, b):
    return lambda f : f(a, b)
```
Implement car and cdr.

Problem 7:

This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.

Problem 8:

This problem was asked by Google.
A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.
Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.
For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:

```
   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 1   1
```

Problem 9:

This problem was asked by Airbnb.
Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.
For example, [2, 4, 6, 8] should return 12, since we pick 4 and 8. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

Problem 10:

This problem was asked by Apple.
Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

Problem 11:

This problem was asked by Twitter.
Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.
For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].
Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

Problem 12:

This problem was asked by Amazon.
There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

```
1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
```

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

Problem 13:
This problem was asked by Amazon.
Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".

Problem 14:

This problem was asked by Google.
The area of a circle is defined as r^2. Estimate \pi to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.
Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 = r^2.

Problem 16:

This problem was asked by Twitter.
You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:
record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N. You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

Problem 17:

This problem was asked by Google.
Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:
The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```

The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory subdir2 containing a file file.ext.
The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
```
The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file file2.ext.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Problem 18:

This problem was asked by Google.
Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.
For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:

10 = max(10, 5, 2)
7 = max(5, 2, 7)
8 = max(2, 7, 8)
8 = max(7, 8, 7)
Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.

Problem 19:

This problem was asked by Facebook.
A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.
Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.

Problem 20:

This problem was asked by Google.
Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.
For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.
In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.
Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.

Problem 21:

This problem was asked by Snapchat.
Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.
For example, given [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)], you should return 2.

Problem 22:

This problem was asked by Microsoft.
Given a dictionary of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a list. If there is more than one possible reconstruction, return any of them. If there is no possible reconstruction, then return null.
For example, given the set of words 'quick', 'brown', 'the', 'fox', and the string "thequickbrownfox", you should return ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'].
Given the set of words 'bed', 'bath', 'bedbath', 'and', 'beyond', and the string "bedbathandbeyond", return either ['bed', 'bath', 'and', 'beyond] or ['bedbath', 'and', 'beyond'].

Problem 26:

This problem was asked by Google.
Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.
The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.
Do this in constant space and in one pass.

Problem 27:

This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).
For example, given the string "([])", you should return true.
Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

Problem 29:

This problem was asked by Amazon.
Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".
Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.
